House Price Prediction  - Advanced Regression Techniques

  1.Fetched Dataset from kaggle
  
  2.Did initial preprocessing by handling missing values
  
  3.Extensive EDA is done to obtain relationships between different features and to get other insights
  
  4.Categorical Values are handled according to the ordinality
  
  5.Ordered categories are label encoded and others are One hot encoded.
  
  6.Dimensionality reduction is done.
  
  7.modelling - Lasso, ElasticNet, Ridge along with XGboost is applied
  
  8.Hypertuning is performed
  
  9.Best model is used to create submission file
  
RMSE score is 1.26.
Future work is to apply stacked regressors to improve accuracy
