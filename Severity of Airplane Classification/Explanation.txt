Steps deployed to predict Severity
1.Import the dataset and neccesary libraries
2.Preprocess the data check for outliers,null values,missing values and remove them
3.plot correleation plot and apply feature selection to select the most important features
4.try out different multiclass models such as Logistic regression,Catboost,XGBoost,RandomForest and neural networks.
5.Select the best parameter and hypertune the model
6.Create submission csv using predicted values
