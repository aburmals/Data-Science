Severity of Airplane crash prediction

Flying has been the go-to mode of travel for years now; it is time-saving, affordable, and extremely convenient. According to the FAA, 2,781,971 passengers fly every day in the US, as in June 2019. Passengers reckon that flying is very safe, considering strict inspections are conducted and security measures are taken to avoid and/or mitigate any mishappenings. However, there remain a few chances of unfortunate incidents.

Imagine you have been hired by a leading airline. You are required to build Machine Learning models to anticipate and classify the severity of any airplane accident based on past incidents. With this, all airlines, even the entire aviation industry, can predict the severity of airplane accidents caused due to various factors and, correspondingly, have a plan of action to minimize the risk associated with them.


Data is procured from Hackerearth competition

Steps deployed to predict Severity

1.Import the dataset and neccesary libraries

2.Preprocess the data check for outliers,null values,missing values and remove them

3.Exploratory Data Analysis is performed to see trends and relationships between different features.

4.plot correleation plot and apply feature selection to select the most important features

5.try out different multiclass models such as Logistic regression,Catboost,XGBoost,RandomForest and neural networks.

6.Select the best parameter and hypertune the model

7.Create submission csv using predicted values
