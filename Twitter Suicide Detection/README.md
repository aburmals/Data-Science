Twitter Suicide Prediction

The aim of the project is to classify tweets made by users as either suicidal or non-suicidal using NLP techniques (Sentiment Analysis)

1.Twitter API is used to fetch real time tweet data filtered by certain phrases indicating suicidality (Research Paper insight)

2.RAW Tweets in JSON is extracted and made into a CSV

3.Initial Text preprocessing of tweets is performed

4.Removed unwanted info (Hastags, tweet URL,RT tweets)

5.Emoji is handled

6.Further EDA like Word cloud is performed to see trend in suicide Tweet

7.Further Data processing is done (Tokenizing, Word embedding etc)

8. Stacked Neural network (LSTM + CNN) is applied which yielded best results

9. Model generated which is to be deployed in a website (future work )
